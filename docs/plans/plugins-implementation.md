# Open Design Plugin & Marketplace — Implementation Plan (living)

Source spec: [`docs/plugins-spec.md`](../plugins-spec.md) (zh-CN: [`docs/plugins-spec.zh-CN.md`](../plugins-spec.zh-CN.md)).

Sibling docs: [`spec.md`](../spec.md) · [`skills-protocol.md`](../skills-protocol.md) · [`architecture.md`](../architecture.md).

Update protocol — read first

- This file is a **living roadmap**. Every PR that lands a chunk of the plugin system must flip the matching `[ ]` to `[x]` in the same PR, and update §3 "Architecture state" if a new module / table / endpoint becomes real.
- Do not edit `docs/plugins-spec.md` from this file's PRs except to fix factual drift; the spec is the contract, this file is the schedule.
- The "Definition of done" gates in §8 are the **only** hard sign-off bar; an empty checkbox under a phase does not mean v1 is broken — only an empty checkbox under §8 does.
- When `docs/plugins-spec.md` patches change phase numbering or atom names, mirror those changes here in the same PR (per §21.6 / §22.5 / §23.6 of the spec).

## 1. Invariants (lock these first; never violate without a spec patch)

These are the five rules that decide every downstream design decision. They sit above phases and are checked by reviewers on every plugin-related PR.

- [x] **I1. `SKILL.md` is the floor; `open-design.json` is a sidecar; never bidirectionally couple.** `packages/plugin-runtime/adapters/agent-skill.ts` synthesizes a schema-valid `PluginManifest` from `SKILL.md` `od:` frontmatter (verified via `packages/plugin-runtime/tests/adapter-agent-skill.test.ts`). The bundled e2e fixture under `apps/daemon/tests/fixtures/plugin-fixtures/sample-plugin/` ships both halves and `apps/daemon/tests/plugins-e2e-fixture.test.ts` exercises the merger.
- [x] **I2. Apply is a pure function; side effects only after `POST /api/projects` / `POST /api/runs`.** `apps/daemon/src/plugins/apply.ts` is FS- and DB-free; the snapshot writer (`snapshots.ts`) and installer are the only modules that mutate persistent state. `apps/daemon/tests/plugins-apply.test.ts` asserts deterministic snapshots from the same inputs and refuses to touch the registry / FS.
- [x] **I3. `AppliedPluginSnapshot` is the only contract between "plugin" and "run".** `composeSystemPrompt()` now accepts a `pluginBlock` derived from the snapshot via `pluginPromptBlock(snapshot)` (`apps/daemon/src/plugins/apply.ts`); the run reads context through the snapshot. Plugin runs in web API-fallback mode are rejected at the HTTP layer (Phase 2A wires the 409); the snapshot table is the only writable surface for the contract.
- [ ] **I4. CLI is the canonical agent-facing API; UI mirrors CLI, not the other way round.** Phase 1: `od plugin install/list/info/uninstall/apply/doctor` and the matching `/api/plugins/*` HTTP routes ship in the same PR. Remaining `od project/run/files/conversation/marketplace` subcommands roll in over Phase 1 / 2C / 3 PRs.
- [x] **I5. Kernel/userspace boundary (spec §23) is drawn from day 1.** `composeSystemPrompt()` is structured as a pure assembler with a content table (DESIGN.md, craft, skill, plugin block, metadata); the new `pluginBlock` parameter slots in without restructuring. Phase 2A lifts the renderer into `packages/contracts/src/prompts/plugin-block.ts` (PB1).

CI guard placement: each invariant must have at least one automated test that fails when the rule is violated. The test path is recorded next to the box when it lands.

Hard layering rules

- `packages/plugin-runtime` does not import `node:fs`. It receives `loader: (relpath) => Promise<string>`. Daemon injects real FS, CI injects mocks, web preview sandbox injects fetch.
- `apps/daemon/src/plugins/snapshots.ts` is the only file that issues `INSERT/UPDATE` against `applied_plugin_snapshots`. CI guard: `rg "applied_plugin_snapshots" --type ts -g '!**/*.test.ts'` may match `INSERT` only inside `snapshots.ts`.
- `connector-gate.ts` is a stateless validator (`(snapshotId, connectorId) => allow | deny`); `tool-tokens.ts` calls it before issuing a token, and `/api/tools/connectors/execute` re-validates on every call to defeat token replacement.

Three reads from the graph (drove the §6 phase reorder)

- `snapshots.ts` is the keystone. It must land in Phase 1 week 1, before pipeline / genui / connector-gate.
- `pipeline.ts` and `genui/*` are co-required for the first marketable plugin (`make-a-deck` needs `direction-picker` + `oauth-prompt`); they must land in the same phase.
- CLI and Web parallelize cleanly once `ApplyResult` JSON is stable; the only sync point is the ND-JSON event schema in `packages/contracts/src/plugins/events.ts`.

---

## 5. Foundations (early bedrock — invest in Phase 0–1 to avoid Phase 3+ rework)

- [x] **F1. Freeze `manifestSourceDigest` algorithm in Phase 0.** Implementation in `packages/plugin-runtime/src/digest.ts`; input `{manifest, inputs, resolvedContextRefs}` → sha256 hex. `packages/plugin-runtime/tests/digest.test.ts` pins 2 known-good digests + canonical-key-order invariant; daemon upgrades cannot change them.
- [x] **F2. Define `PersistedAgentEvent` plugin variants in Phase 1, even if they fire later.** Variants live in `packages/contracts/src/plugins/events.ts` (`pipeline_stage_*`, `genui_surface_*`); pipeline / genui emitters land Phase 2A.
- [x] **F3. `installed_plugins.source_kind` accepts `'bundled'` from Phase 1.** `PluginSourceKindSchema` permissive: `bundled / user / project / marketplace / github / url / local`.
- [x] **F4. `PluginAssetRef.stageAt` defaults to `'run-start'`, never `'project-create'`.** Default baked into `packages/contracts/src/plugins/apply.ts`.
- [ ] **F5. `--json` output uses contracts types; no inline reshape in `cli.ts`.** Phase 1 CLI ships `--json` for `list/info/apply/doctor` returning the daemon JSON verbatim; the next CLI rev imports `ApplyResult` etc. from contracts to satisfy the compile-time guarantee.
- [x] **F6. `OD_MAX_DEVLOOP_ITERATIONS` lives in `apps/daemon/src/app-config.ts`, default 10, override via env.** Read via `readPluginEnvKnobs()`; consumed by Phase 2A `pipeline.ts`.
- [ ] **F7. `od plugin doctor` validates `od.connectors.required[]` against `connectorService.listAll()` from Phase 1.** Phase 1 doctor validates manifest schema, atoms, and resolved skill / DS / craft refs; the connector lookup wires in once `connectorService` is exposed to the doctor module (Phase 1 cleanup PR).
- [ ] **F8. Cross-conversation cache (`genui_surfaces` lookup) goes live with the table — i.e. Phase 2A — and a daemon test asserts the second `oauth-prompt` does not broadcast.** Pulled forward from spec §16 Phase 2A's e2e (e) so the behavior is verified at unit-test layer, not only e2e.
- [x] **F9. Snapshot lifecycle env vars (PB2)** live in `apps/daemon/src/app-config.ts` from Phase 1: `OD_SNAPSHOT_UNREFERENCED_TTL_DAYS` (default `30`, set to `0` to disable), `OD_SNAPSHOT_RETENTION_DAYS` (default unset, opt-in), `OD_SNAPSHOT_GC_INTERVAL_MS` (default `6 * 60 * 60 * 1000`). All three live in `readPluginEnvKnobs()`; `applied_plugin_snapshots.expires_at` is stamped on insert; the GC worker lands Phase 5.

---

## 6. Phase plan (re-ordered from spec §16 by dependency, not by user-visible feature)

The spec §16 ordering is reader-facing; this is the build order. Each phase has explicit deliverables, validation steps, and an exit criterion. Flip checkboxes in PRs that land each item.

### Phase 0 — Spec freeze + contracts skeleton (1–2 d)

Deliverables

- [x] `docs/schemas/open-design.plugin.v1.json` — JSON Schema v1.
- [x] `docs/schemas/open-design.marketplace.v1.json` — JSON Schema v1.
- [x] `packages/contracts/src/plugins/{manifest,context,apply,marketplace,installed,events}.ts` (types + Zod schemas; no logic).
- [x] Re-export from `packages/contracts/src/index.ts`.
- [x] `packages/plugin-runtime/src/digest.ts` with frozen sha256 algorithm + fixture cases (`packages/plugin-runtime/tests/digest.test.ts`).

Validation

- [x] `pnpm --filter @open-design/plugin-runtime test`
- [x] `pnpm guard && pnpm typecheck`
- [x] CI digest stability: re-running `digest()` on the fixtures matches the pinned hex.

Exit criterion

- Importing `import type { ApplyResult, AppliedPluginSnapshot } from '@open-design/contracts'` works from daemon and web. ✓ verified.

### Phase 1 — Loader + installer + apply + snapshot + headless CLI loop (5–7 d)

Why merged with the spec's "headless MVP CLI loop" — see I4. The spec's Phase 1 explicitly pulls this forward; this plan keeps that.

Deliverables (week 1: data layer)

- [x] SQLite migration for `installed_plugins`, `plugin_marketplaces`, `applied_plugin_snapshots` (including `expires_at INTEGER` per PB2). The `runs` table is in-memory in `apps/daemon/src/runs.ts`; the in-memory run carries the snapshot id today. `projects` and `conversations` get `applied_plugin_snapshot_id` ALTERs in `migratePlugins()`.
- [x] `apps/daemon/src/app-config.ts` defines `OD_SNAPSHOT_UNREFERENCED_TTL_DAYS` (default `30`), `OD_SNAPSHOT_RETENTION_DAYS` (default unset), `OD_SNAPSHOT_GC_INTERVAL_MS`, and `OD_MAX_DEVLOOP_ITERATIONS` (F6) under `readPluginEnvKnobs()`. Apply path stamps `expires_at` on insert; GC worker lands Phase 5.
- [x] `packages/plugin-runtime` parsers / adapters / merger / resolver / validator + digest.
- [x] `apps/daemon/src/plugins/registry.ts` — install-root scan, sidecar + adapter merge, SQLite reader/writer. (Hot reload + project tier scan land Phase 2A.)
- [x] `apps/daemon/src/plugins/installer.ts` — local folder install with path-traversal guard, 50 MiB size cap, symlink rejection. GitHub tarball / HTTPS sources land Phase 2A.
- [x] `apps/daemon/src/plugins/apply.ts` — pure; emits `ApplyResult` with draft snapshot.
- [x] `apps/daemon/src/plugins/snapshots.ts` — sole writer of `applied_plugin_snapshots`. (Repo-level `rg` guard wiring in `scripts/guard.ts` lands in the Phase 2A polish PR.)
- [ ] Refactor `apps/daemon/src/{skills,design-systems,craft}.ts` to delegate to `registry.ts`. Phase 1 keeps the existing loaders independent so `/api/skills`, `/api/design-systems`, `/api/craft` endpoints remain byte-for-byte stable; Phase 2A folds them into the plugin registry.

Deliverables (week 2: surface layer)

- [x] HTTP: `GET /api/plugins`, `GET /api/plugins/:id`, `POST /api/plugins/install` (SSE), `POST /api/plugins/:id/uninstall`, `POST /api/plugins/:id/apply`, `POST /api/plugins/:id/doctor`, `GET /api/atoms`, `GET /api/applied-plugins/:snapshotId`. `POST /api/projects` / `POST /api/runs` continue to accept their existing payloads; the explicit `pluginId` / `appliedPluginSnapshotId` plumbing lands as a follow-up Phase 1 PR once the `runs` SQL migration is in place.
- [x] `composeSystemPrompt()` in `apps/daemon/src/prompts/system.ts` accepts a `pluginBlock` rendered from the snapshot via `pluginPromptBlock(snapshot)` and emits `## Active plugin` + `## Plugin inputs` sections. Shape: pure assembler + content table (per I5).
- [x] CLI: `od plugin install/list/info/uninstall/apply/doctor`. `od project / run / files` subcommands stay scheduled for the Phase 1 follow-up PR.
- [ ] Phase 1 `od plugin doctor` covers: schema validation, SKILL.md parse, atom id existence check, resolved-context ref check, digest drift detection. MCP dry-launch and connector existence (F7) land in the Phase 1 cleanup PR.

Validation

- [x] `pnpm --filter @open-design/plugin-runtime test` covers: digest stability, `parseManifest` + `parseMarketplace`, SKILL frontmatter adapter, sidecar+adapter merge precedence, `validateSafe` cross-field rules.
- [x] `apps/daemon/tests/plugins-{apply,snapshots,installer,e2e-fixture}.test.ts` cover apply purity, snapshot writer, installer guards, and the closed-loop install→apply→snapshot→doctor walk.
- [x] **e2e-1 closed loop** — `apps/daemon/tests/plugins-e2e-fixture.test.ts` runs the §12.5 walk against the bundled `apps/daemon/tests/fixtures/plugin-fixtures/sample-plugin/` fixture without spinning the HTTP server.
- [ ] **e2e-2 pure apply across runs** — Phase 1 follow-up: drive `applyPlugin` through `POST /api/plugins/:id/apply` against a running daemon and assert two consecutive applies share the same `manifestSourceDigest`.
- [ ] **e2e-3 headless run** — needs `od daemon start --headless` (Phase 1.5) and the `od run start --plugin <id>` plumbing (Phase 1 follow-up).

Exit criterion

- Phase 1 daemon-only walkthrough is green: `od plugin install --source <fixture>` → `od plugin list` → `od plugin apply <id>` produces a stable `AppliedPluginSnapshot`. The §12.5 web-driven walkthrough requires the Phase 1 follow-up PR + Phase 1.5 headless flag.

### Phase 1.5 — Headless daemon lifecycle subset (1 d)

Pulled out of spec §16 Phase 5 because Phase 1 e2e needs it. Avoids "Phase 1 looks green on macOS desktop, breaks on Linux CI" false positives.

Deliverables

- [ ] `od daemon start --headless` flag (no electron, no web bundle).
- [ ] `od daemon start --serve-web` flag (web UI without electron).
- [ ] Honor `OD_BIND_HOST`, `OD_DATA_DIR`, `OD_MEDIA_CONFIG_DIR`, `OD_NAMESPACE` in headless mode.
- [ ] `od daemon stop`, `od daemon status --json`.

Validation

- [ ] `od daemon start --headless --port 17456` then `curl :17456/api/plugins` returns `[]` (no electron involved).
- [ ] Phase 1 e2e suite re-run inside `docker run --rm node:24-bookworm-slim` succeeds.

### Phase 2A — Pipeline + devloop + GenUI(confirmation/oauth-prompt) + connector-gate + Web inline rail (4–6 d)

Deliverables (daemon)

- [ ] `apps/daemon/src/plugins/pipeline.ts` — stage scheduler; `until` evaluator (closed vocabulary: `critique.score`, `iterations`, `user.confirmed`, `preview.ok`); devloop with `OD_MAX_DEVLOOP_ITERATIONS` ceiling.
- [ ] SQLite migration: `run_devloop_iterations`, `genui_surfaces` (with three indexes per §11.4), plus the `connectors_required_json` / `connectors_resolved_json` / `mcp_servers_json` columns on `applied_plugin_snapshots` if not added in Phase 1.
- [ ] `apps/daemon/src/genui/{registry,events,store}.ts` — surfaces for `confirmation` and `oauth-prompt` first; reuse the existing `apps/daemon/src/connectors/` flow for `oauth.route='connector'` and the existing MCP OAuth flow for `oauth.route='mcp'`.
- [ ] Cross-conversation cache (F8): on `persist='project'` / `persist='conversation'` lookup hit + valid `schema_digest` + unexpired, emit `genui_surface_response { respondedBy: 'cache' }` without broadcasting a request.
- [ ] `apps/daemon/src/plugins/connector-gate.ts` — apply path resolves `od.connectors.required[]` against `connectorService.listAll()`; auto-derives implicit `oauth-prompt` (`__auto_connector_<id>`, `persist='project'`) for not-yet-connected required connectors. Token-issuance path validates plugin trust × `connector:<id>`. `/api/tools/connectors/execute` re-validates on every call.
- [ ] HTTP: `GET /api/runs/:runId/genui`, `GET /api/projects/:projectId/genui`, `POST /api/runs/:runId/genui/:surfaceId/respond`, `POST /api/projects/:projectId/genui/:surfaceId/revoke`, `POST /api/projects/:projectId/genui/prefill`, `POST /api/runs/:runId/replay`, `GET /api/runs/:runId/devloop-iterations`.
- [ ] SSE / ND-JSON streams emit `pipeline_stage_started`, `pipeline_stage_completed`, `genui_surface_request`, `genui_surface_response`, `genui_surface_timeout`, `genui_state_synced` per the contracts variants from F2.
- [ ] Web API-fallback rejection: when web sidecar detects fallback path with `pluginId`, return `409 plugin-requires-daemon`.
- [ ] **Lift the `## Active plugin` renderer into `packages/contracts/src/prompts/plugin-block.ts` (PB1).** Pure function `renderPluginBlock(snapshot: AppliedPluginSnapshot): string` with no fs / db dependencies. Phase 1 placed the block string-template inline in `apps/daemon/src/prompts/system.ts`; Phase 2A moves the template to contracts and the daemon composer becomes a one-line import. Web API-fallback still rejects plugin runs with 409 (a snapshot-less prompt has no use for the renderer), so this is hygiene-only — but it removes the spec §11.8 byte-equality CI cross-check fixture from the future Phase 4 backlog and makes the eventual fallback-mode plugin support a one-line wiring change.

Deliverables (CLI)

- [ ] `od plugin trust` (accepts `connector:<id>` form per §9.1), `od plugin apply --grant-caps`, exit code 66 with structured stderr, exit code 73 for awaiting GenUI.
- [ ] `od ui list/show/respond/revoke/prefill`.
- [ ] `od plugin replay <runId>`.
- [ ] `od run watch` ND-JSON includes `genui_*` and `pipeline_stage_*` events.

Deliverables (web)

- [ ] `applyPlugin(pluginId, projectId?)` helper in `apps/web/src/state/projects.ts`.
- [ ] `InlinePluginsRail`, `ContextChipStrip`, `PluginInputsForm`. Mounted in `NewProjectPanel` only this phase (`ChatComposer` waits for Phase 2B).
- [ ] `GenUISurfaceRenderer` for `confirmation` + `oauth-prompt` (cards / modal); subscribes to `genui_surface_request`; calls respond endpoint.
- [ ] `GenUIInbox` drawer in `ProjectView`.

Validation

- [ ] **e2e-4 replay invariance**, **e2e-5 GenUI cross-conversation**, **e2e-6 connector gate**, **e2e-7 api-fallback rejection** — see §8.
- [ ] Daemon unit test: pipeline stage scheduler runs a plugin with `repeat: true; until: 'critique.score>=4 || iterations>=3'` and converges in ≤3 iterations on a stub critique source.
- [ ] Daemon unit test: per F8, second oauth-prompt request in the same project does not broadcast.

### Phase 2A.5 — GenUI form + choice + JSON Schema renderer (2–3 d)

Deliverables

- [ ] `GenUISurfaceRenderer` extended for `form` and `choice`; JSON Schema → React form bridge (small, in-tree; no external dep added without review).
- [ ] CLI parity: `od ui show` returns the schema for headless rendering.

Validation

- [ ] Daemon test: a `form` surface answered via `od ui respond --value-json '...'` writes through the same path as a UI answer; the `genui_surface_response` event has `respondedBy: 'user'` in both cases.

### Phase 2B — Marketplace deep UI + ChatComposer apply + preview sandbox (4–6 d)

Deliverables

- [ ] Routes `/marketplace`, `/marketplace/:id` in `apps/web/src/router.ts`.
- [ ] `MarketplaceView`, `PluginDetailView`.
- [ ] `ChatComposer` integrates `InlinePluginsRail` + `ContextChipStrip` + `PluginInputsForm`. `applyPlugin()` accepts current `projectId`.
- [ ] `GET /api/plugins/:id/preview` and `/api/plugins/:id/example/:name` with the §9.2 sandbox CSP, `sandbox="allow-scripts"` only.
- [ ] Preview path traversal / symlink / size guards.

Validation

- [ ] Browser test: a malicious-fixture preview cannot fetch `/api/*` (CSP `connect-src 'none'`).
- [ ] e2e: install local plugin → marketplace → detail preview → "Use" → Home or ChatComposer prefilled → run produces design.

### Phase 2C — Advanced CLI: files write/upload/delete/diff, project import, run logs (2–3 d)

Deliverables

- [ ] `od files write/upload/delete/diff`.
- [ ] `od project delete/import`, `od run list/logs --since`.
- [ ] `od conversation list/new/info` (basic).

Validation

- [ ] Extend the §12.5 walk-through: `od project import` an external folder → `od plugin apply` → `od plugin replay <runId>` reruns on top.

### Phase 3 — Federated marketplaces + tiered trust + bundle plugins (3–5 d)

Deliverables

- [ ] `od marketplace add/remove/trust/untrust/list/refresh`. `od plugin install <name>` resolves through configured marketplaces.
- [ ] `GET / POST /api/marketplaces`, `POST /api/marketplaces/:id/trust`, `GET /api/marketplaces/:id/plugins`.
- [ ] Trust UI on `PluginDetailView` (capability checklist + Grant action).
- [ ] Apply pipeline gates by `trust` + `capabilities_granted` (already partly in Phase 2A; this phase wires UI + marketplace).
- [ ] Bundle plugin installer (multiple skills + DS + craft → registry under namespaced ids).
- [ ] `od plugin doctor <id>` runs full validation including bundle expansion.

Validation

- [ ] e2e: install plugin from a local mock `marketplace.json`, rotate ref, uninstall.
- [ ] e2e: restricted plugin cannot start MCP server until Grant clicked; check `applied_plugin_snapshots.capabilities_granted` updates.

### Phase 4 — Atoms exposure, publish-back, AG-UI adapter, full CLI parity (1–2 wk; splittable)

Deliverables

- [ ] `docs/atoms.md`; `GET /api/atoms` returns implemented + reserved (with `(planned)` marker).
- [ ] `od plugin export <projectId> --as od|claude-plugin|agent-skill`.
- [ ] `od plugin run <id> --input k=v --follow` (apply + run start + watch wrapper).
- [ ] `od plugin scaffold` interactive starter.
- [ ] `od plugin publish --to anthropics-skills|awesome-agent-skills|clawhub` (PR template launcher).
- [ ] CLI parity remainder: `od skills/design-systems/craft/atoms list/show`, `od status/doctor/version`, `od config get/set/list/unset`, `od marketplace search`.
- [ ] Optional `plugins/_official/atoms/<atom>/SKILL.md` extraction (spec §23.3.2 patch 2).
- [ ] `@open-design/agui-adapter` package; `GET /api/runs/:runId/agui` SSE endpoint emits AG-UI canonical events.
- [ ] Plugin manifest upgrade: `od.genui.surfaces[].component` (capability gate `genui:custom-component`).

Validation

- [ ] **e2e-9 UI ↔ CLI parity**: pick 5 desktop UI workflows; replay each through `od …` only; produced artifacts byte-for-byte equal.
- [ ] AG-UI smoke: a CopilotKit React client subscribes to `/api/runs/:runId/agui` and renders surfaces unmodified.

### Phase 5 — Cloud deployment (parallel; can start after Phase 1.5)

Deliverables

- [ ] `linux/amd64` + `linux/arm64` Dockerfile per spec §15.1 (`node:24-bookworm-slim` base, non-root uid 10001, bundled `ffmpeg` / `git` / `ripgrep`).
- [ ] CI pushes `:edge` on main, `:<version>` on tag.
- [ ] `tools/pack/docker-compose.yml`, `tools/pack/helm/`.
- [ ] Bound-API-token guard: daemon refuses to bind `OD_BIND_HOST=0.0.0.0` without `OD_API_TOKEN`; bearer middleware on `/api/*` skipped only on loopback.
- [ ] `ProjectStorage` adapter for S3-compatible blob stores.
- [ ] `DaemonDb` adapter for Postgres.
- [ ] **Snapshot retention enforcement job (PB2).** Periodic worker (default every 6 h, knob `OD_SNAPSHOT_GC_INTERVAL_MS`) deletes `applied_plugin_snapshots` rows where `expires_at IS NOT NULL AND expires_at <= now()`. When `OD_SNAPSHOT_RETENTION_DAYS` is set, the worker additionally retires referenced rows older than the window if and only if the referencing run/conversation/project is itself terminal. Audit log entry per deletion. CLI escape hatch: `od plugin snapshots prune --before <ts>` for forced cleanup. Plays alongside §15.7 hosted defaults.

Validation

- [ ] `docker run` smoke: image starts, web UI renders, `od plugin install` works inside container.
- [ ] Multi-cloud smoke: deploy compose to AWS Fargate, GCP Cloud Run, Azure Container Apps; produce a fixed plugin's artifact byte-for-byte equal across clouds.
- [ ] Pluggable storage smoke: same plugin alternated between local-disk + SQLite and S3 + Postgres; artifacts identical.

### Phase 6 / 7 / 8 — Post-v1 native scenario coverage (per spec §21.4)

These are tracked but **not part of v1 sign-off**. Listed here so spec patches that promote `(planned)` atoms have a place to update.

- [ ] **Phase 6 — figma-migration native**: implement `figma-extract` + `token-map`; ship official `figma-migration` plugin.
- [ ] **Phase 7 — code-migration native** (§20.3 §21.3.2): `code-import`, `design-extract`, `rewrite-plan`, `patch-edit`, `diff-review`, `build-test` evaluator; freeze target-stack contract; freeze design-token mapping contract.
- [ ] **Phase 8 — production code delivery native**: repo-aware multi-file patch orchestration; native review-and-apply surface; promote `handoffKind: 'deployable-app'` from reservation to implementation.

## 7. Spec decisions (locked)

These were originally spec §18 open questions; they are now resolved and propagated into both this plan and `docs/plugins-spec.md` proper. Future spec patches that revisit them must update both files in the same PR.

- **PB1. Lift `## Active plugin` block into `packages/contracts/src/prompts/plugin-block.ts` in Phase 2A** (was Phase 4). **Decision: accepted as proposed.** Both `composeSystemPrompt()` implementations (daemon + contracts) import the same renderer. Spec §11.8 patched to drop the "Phase 4 lifts the block" bullet and the CI byte-equality cross-check fixture; spec §18 patched to mark the open question resolved. Plan §6 Phase 2A gains the deliverable; Phase 4 loses it.
- **PB2. `AppliedPluginSnapshot` unreferenced-row TTL.** **Decision: accepted with one modification** to preserve spec §8.2.1's reproducibility-first stance. Final shape:
  - `applied_plugin_snapshots.expires_at INTEGER` column lands in Phase 1 (NULL allowed).
  - Snapshots referenced by any `runs.applied_plugin_snapshot_id` / `conversations.applied_plugin_snapshot_id` / `projects.applied_plugin_snapshot_id` keep `expires_at = NULL` (pinned forever; reproducibility unchanged).
  - Unreferenced snapshots receive `expires_at = applied_at + OD_SNAPSHOT_UNREFERENCED_TTL_DAYS` (default **30 d**, set to `0` to disable). This is the apply-then-cancel garbage-growth defense.
  - The "expire even referenced" knob `OD_SNAPSHOT_RETENTION_DAYS` is **operator-opt-in only**, default unset; when set, a referenced row may expire if `applied_at` is older than the window AND the referencing row is itself terminal (run finished, conversation archived, project deleted).
  - Both env vars live in `apps/daemon/src/app-config.ts` (per F6 pattern). Phase 1 ships the column + config wiring; Phase 5 ships the periodic enforcement job.
  - Spec §11.4 patched to add the `expires_at` column; spec §18 patched to mark the open question resolved.

## 8. Definition of done (the hard sign-off bar for v1)

v1 ships when **all** of the following pass on a clean Linux CI container without electron. Each row links to the daemon / e2e test path that asserts it (fill in path when the test lands).

- [ ] **e2e-1 cold install** — `od plugin install ./fixtures/sample-plugin` →
  - `~/.open-design/plugins/sample-plugin/` exists.
  - `installed_plugins` has one row with `trust='restricted'`, `source_kind='local'`.
  - Test path: `_TBD_`
- [ ] **e2e-2 pure apply** — `od plugin apply sample-plugin --project p --json` →
  - stdout parses as `ApplyResult`.
  - `applied_plugin_snapshots` has a new row with `run_id IS NULL`.
  - Project cwd has zero new files; no `.mcp.json`.
  - Test path: `_TBD_`
- [ ] **e2e-3 headless run** — `od run start --project p --plugin sample-plugin --follow` →
  - First ND-JSON event has `kind='pipeline_stage_started'`.
  - Final artifact bytes equal those from the same plugin under the Phase 2A UI flow.
  - `runs.applied_plugin_snapshot_id` is non-null.
  - Test path: `_TBD_`
- [ ] **e2e-4 replay invariance** — after `od plugin update sample-plugin` (new version), `od plugin replay <runId>` →
  - New run's prompt is byte-equal to the original run's prompt.
  - New run reuses the original snapshot row (`status='fresh'`); the upgrade did not pollute it.
  - Test path: `_TBD_`
- [ ] **e2e-5 GenUI cross-conversation** — plugin declares `oauth-prompt(persist='project')`. After conv A resolves it, conv B re-applying the plugin →
  - No `genui_surface_request` is broadcast.
  - A `genui_surface_response { respondedBy: 'cache' }` event is emitted.
  - Test path: `_TBD_`
- [ ] **e2e-6 connector trust gate** — plugin declares `od.connectors.required = [{ id: 'slack', tools: ['channels.list'] }]`, `connector:slack` not granted →
  - `od plugin apply` exits 66 with stderr JSON containing `data.required` including `connector:slack`.
  - `curl /api/tools/connectors/execute` (simulating bypass) returns `403 connector-not-granted`.
  - Test path: `_TBD_`
- [ ] **e2e-7 api-fallback rejection** — daemon stopped, web fallback mode triggers a plugin run →
  - `409 plugin-requires-daemon`.
  - Restarting the daemon restores normal flow.
  - Test path: `_TBD_`
- [ ] **e2e-8 apply purity regression** — run `od plugin apply` then cancel, 100×.
  - Project cwd byte size unchanged.
  - `applied_plugin_snapshots` row count grows by 100.
  - No staged assets; no `.mcp.json`.
  - Test path: `_TBD_`

Plus repo-wide gates

- [ ] `pnpm guard` clean.

- [ ] `pnpm --filter @open-design/contracts test` clean.
- [ ] `pnpm --filter @open-design/plugin-runtime test` clean.
- [ ] `pnpm --filter @open-design/daemon test` clean.
- [ ] `pnpm --filter @open-design/web test` clean.
